    For timeout values (`connect_timeout`, `http2_keep_alive_timeout`,
    `pool_idle_timeout`, and `timeout`), values can either be Python `timedelta`
    objects, or they can be "human-readable duration strings".

    The human-readable duration string is a concatenation of time spans. Where each time
    span is an integer number and a suffix. Supported suffixes:

    - `nsec`, `ns` -- nanoseconds
    - `usec`, `us` -- microseconds
    - `msec`, `ms` -- milliseconds
    - `seconds`, `second`, `sec`, `s`
    - `minutes`, `minute`, `min`, `m`
    - `hours`, `hour`, `hr`, `h`
    - `days`, `day`, `d`
    - `weeks`, `week`, `w`
    - `months`, `month`, `M` -- defined as 30.44 days
    - `years`, `year`, `y` -- defined as 365.25 days

    For example:

    - `"2h 37min"`
    - `"32ms"`
